### ## üìà Key Insights Discovered

My analysis of the data revealed several key findings:

* **Insight 1: Pricing Power of Central Arrondissements:** *`[Example: Properties in the 6th (Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s) and 7th (Eiffel Tower) arrondissements command a 45% higher average nightly rate than the city average.]`*
* **Insight 2: High Demand for "Entire Home/Apt":** *`[Example: "Entire home/apt" listings, while only making up 60% of properties, generate over 85% of the total estimated revenue, indicating massive demand.]`*
* **Insight 3: August is the Peak Booking Month:** *`[Example: There is a clear seasonal trend, with booking prices and occupancy peaking in August, likely driven by summer tourism.]`*

### ## üìÇ Data & Source Files

* **`Paris_Airbnb.pbix`:** The Power BI source file containing all the data models, queries, and report pages.
* **`data/` folder:** Contains the raw (`listings.csv`) and cleaned (`Paris Cleaned Dataset.csv`) data used for the analysis.

### ## ü§î Challenges & Future Improvements

* **Challenge:** *`[Example: The initial dataset contained significant missing values in the 'price' and 'last_review' columns, which required careful imputation and cleaning in Power Query to ensure data quality.]`*
* **Future Work:** *`[Example: In the future, I would like to integrate data from the Paris Metro system to analyze how proximity to a station impacts a listing's price and occupancy.]`*
